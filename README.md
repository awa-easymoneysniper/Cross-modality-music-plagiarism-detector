# Cross-modality-music-plagiarism-detector
A dual-modality framework for music plagiarism detection that unifies MIDI and audio representations. I extracted MIDI and audio embeddings from pre-trained models, and align them via contrastive learning. The model generates a unfied embedding that serves as the reference base for detecting plagiarism through computing cosine similarity.
